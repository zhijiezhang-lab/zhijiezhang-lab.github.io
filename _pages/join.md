Students and postdocs interested in integrating models and experiments to understand the origin and maintenance of biodiversity are encouraged to contact us. Please email zhijie.zhang at pku.edu.cn, outlining your research background, motivation, and potential project ideas, and attaching your CV.

## Postdocs
We are looking for a postdoc with theoretical ecology background to study the coexistence of large number of species, using the Consumer-Resource model. However, candidates with a relevant background and strong publication record should email me as there are several internal and external funding sources. 

## Ph.D students
Prospective Ph.D. students should contact us as early as possible—typically in the sixth semester for bachelor's students or the fifth semester for master's students.

## Undergraduate and Research assistant
We also keep around two undergraduates (or research assistants) working in the lab.
